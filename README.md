# NOTE: This Project is dead and will not be continued anymore

# Rule34.xxx Downloader v1.0.3

Used for downloading content from Rule34.xxx using Rule34.xxx's official APIs.


I noticed that this App/Project was getting old (3 years as of 6th of June 2021) and not so good/modern looking, so I thought I would kind of start to re-work it and make it look nice/modern and a bit more updated.
There are still some flaws like in every App/Project. I release every compiled version on Github so you don't have to compile it yourself, incase you do want, see Requirements below

I am still working on improving it a bit and making it look better.

# Requirements

[.NET Framework 4.7.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-framework-runtime)

[Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
